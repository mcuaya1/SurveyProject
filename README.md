The program allows users to create surveys for others to fill out. The current system allows users to create surveys with a specific topic and add a range of questions for this topic. This survey is then stored in a mock database, which administrators have access to view, remove questions from, and/or delete. Administrators also have access to users' passwords and surveys created.
